In order to realise this project, I decided to create a node js application. I took the data from the OpenWeather API, thanks to axios for the HTTP requests. 

Next, I have created a docker image and then I used docker build for the construction of the image.

With docker push, I have published this image on DockerHub.

Thanks to Trivy, I analysed the vulnerabilities and tried to solve them.
